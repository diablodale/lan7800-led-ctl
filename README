lan7800-led-ctl is a command line tool to control the LEDs connected to a
LAN7800 ethernet controller.

Usually those LEDs show the ethernet status like "Link/Activity" and "Speed".
Using this tool you can turn them off, if you don't like a disco in your room
at night ;-)

These ethernet and USB controllers are used on embedded computers like
Raspberry Pi 3B+.
